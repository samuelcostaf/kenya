            <h2>WHO WE ARE?&#x1F914</h2>
            <p><b>The Valuing Wildlife Project</b> began in 2022, knowing about the drought that killed more than a thousand wild animals in Kenya, we created this project with the aim of, with your help, protecting our animals, our wildlife.</p>

            <h2>A context of Kenya's situation:</h2>
            <p>
                Today, our fauna is suffering from deforestation, invasion of wild habitat, illegal hunting and sale of animals, agricultural expansion, etc. People settled and farmed in areas where animals used to live, in the same way, droughts caused by climate change are leading to water and food shortages in the region, leading to the death of several animals, and we know that this is all to blame it comes from the biggest predator in the world: humans.
            </p>
                
            <p></p>
            
            <p>With this in mind, the valuing wildlife project consists of recovering deteriorated areas and injured animals, and also valuing local communities, in fact, every species has its importance and with just over 8 billion people in the world, if everyone does do what is within your power to protect the lives of wild animals, we will be able to minimize the damage caused over the years and achieve unity in the purpose of conserving the lives of wild animals.
            </p>
